# WeatherApp â›ˆ

WeatherApp is a simple application that shows the current weather based on the provided location. 

All the API calls are facilitaded by using the Retrofit library. The applications consults endpoints provided by:
https://www.metaweather.com/

The app also utilizes Picasso, a well-known Android third party library to easily display images into ImageViews providing its URL.

To run the project you have to open it using Android Studio, and either build in a virtual device or a physical Android device. 

WeatherApp still needs some better improvements like:- 
- First opening the app show the current location weather
- More solid MVVM architecture implementation
- Error handling more efficiently 
- Dleaner code 
- Dependency injection

Unfortunately due to a tight schedule and busy days, they could not be implemented.
