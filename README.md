# WeatherApp â›ˆ

WeatherApp is a simple application that shows the current weather based on the provided location. 

The applications consults endpoints provided by:
https://www.metaweather.com/

To run the project you have to open it using Android Studio, and either build in a virtual device or a physical Android device. 

The app also utilizes Picasso, a well-known Android third party library to easily display images into ImageViews providing its URL.

WeatherApp still needs some better improvements like a more solid MVVM architecture implementation, error handling more efficiently and a cleaner code as well, but unfortunately due to a tight schedule and busy days, they could not be implemented.
